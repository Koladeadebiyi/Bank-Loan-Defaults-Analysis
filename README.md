- **What is the Default Rate Across Different Loan Types?**
  - Auto loans have the highest default rate, followed by mortgage and education loans.
- **Which Bank Branches Have the Highest Default Rates?**
  - The Kano, Lagos, and Abuja branches recorded the highest default rates.
- **How Does Age and Credit Score Affect Loan Defaults?**
  - Borrowers aged 31-40 years had the highest default rates.
  - Lower credit scores (below 330) were strongly linked to higher default rates.
- **Do Larger Loans Have Higher Default Rates?**
  - Loans in the 500K-1M range had the highest default rates, suggesting that mid-sized loans might be riskier than smaller or significantly larger loans.
- **What Loan Terms Lead to More Defaults?**
  - Loans with longer repayment terms (60 months) showed higher default rates.
- **Does a Higher Interest Rate Lead to More Loan Defaults?**
  - Higher interest rates correlated with increased default rates, especially in the 15-26% range.

# Conclusion & Recommendations

- **Enhanced Risk Assessment:** Banks should conduct stricter risk evaluations for borrowers in high-default age groups and those with low credit scores.
- **Loan Term Adjustments:** Shorter repayment periods should be encouraged for high-risk borrowers to reduce default likelihood.
- **Branch-Specific Strategies:** Branches in high-default locations (e.g., Kano, Lagos, Abuja) should implement localized strategies, such as stricter approval processes or tailored repayment plans.
- **Interest Rate Revisions:** Banks should consider flexible interest rate structures to accommodate high-risk borrowers and reduce default probability.
- **Credit Score Improvement Programs:** Financial literacy and credit-building programs should be introduced to help customers improve their credit scores, making them more reliable borrowers.
